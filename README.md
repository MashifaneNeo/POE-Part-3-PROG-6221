Task Management

Add a Task

Use one of the following commands to add a new cybersecurity-related task:

* `Add task Check my privacy settings`
* `Create task Enable two-factor authentication`

The assistant will respond with a message confirming the task and ask if you want to set a reminder.


Tasks will appear in the main window with an indicator of whether each task is complete and whether a reminder is set.

Complete a Task

Mark a task as completed using:

* `Complete task Check my privacy settings`
* `Mark task Enable two-factor authentication as done`

The assistant will confirm the task is completed.

 Delete a Task

To remove a task:

* `Delete task Check my privacy settings`
* `Remove task Enable two-factor authentication`

 Setting Reminders

 After Adding a Task

After adding a task, the bot will prompt:

> Task added: "Review: Check my privacy settings". Would you like a reminder? (e.g., 'Remind me in 3 days')

Reply with:

* `Remind me in 3 days`

This will set a reminder for that task.

 Direct Reminder

You can also directly create a reminder without adding a task first:

* `Remind me to update my password tomorrow`
* `Set a reminder to review my firewall in 2 days`

The assistant will extract the title and schedule the reminder accordingly.

Begin a cybersecurity quiz by typing:

* `Start quiz`
* `Quiz time`
* `Begin quiz`

The quiz will start immediately. Answer each question as prompted.

 Quiz Activity

The assistant logs the start and end of quizzes in the activity log.

 Notes

* The assistant uses simple NLP logic to detect intent from your input.
* You must phrase task and reminder inputs clearly to ensure proper understanding.
* Task titles must be unique for accurate tracking and deletion.
* The activity log stores the last 50 actions; the display is limited to 5 entries by default for readability.
